*Chaitanya Rahalkar, Anushka Virgaonkar, Dhaval Gujar, Sumedh Patkar*  
International Journal of Computer Applications, April 2020  
[PDF](https://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume176/number29/31265-2020920111/ijca2020920111.pdf)

We propose a new way of creating a unified interface for radiologists & researchers to analyze CT scans and support the system with XAI.

### 2019

**[Content Addressed Peer-to-Peer File System for the Web with Blockchain-based Metadata Integrity](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAC347590.2019.9036792)**  
*Chaitanya Rahalkar, Dhaval Gujar*  
IEEE International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication and Control, December 2019  
[PDF](https://github.com/chaitanyarahalkar/temporary-uploads/raw/master/IEEE%20Conference-%2020:11:19.pdf) | [Slides](https://github.com/chaitanyarahalkar/temporary-uploads/raw/master/COMP_26_87_Presentation.pdf)

We propose a new content addressed peer-to-peer file system as a replacement to the bloated HTTP protocol assisted with the robust preservation properties of Blockchain.

**[Using Generative Adversarial Networks for Secure Pseudorandom Number Generation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3319535.3363265)**  
*Rajvardhan Oak, Chaitanya Rahalkar, Dhaval Gujar*  
ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, November 2019  
[PDF](https://github.com/chaitanyarahalkar/temporary-uploads/raw/master/3319535.3363265.pdf)

We propose a new way of generating pseudorandom numbers using generative adversarial networks. We demonstrate that a GAN can act as a Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (CPRNG) passing 97% of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tests.

**[A Secure Password Manager](https://doi.org/10.5120/ijca2019919323)**  
*Chaitanya Rahalkar, Dhaval Gujar*  
International Journal of Computer Applications, September 2019  
[PDF](https://github.com/chaitanyarahalkar/temporary-uploads/raw/master/secure-password-manager.pdf)

We propose an offline password manager, that does not store passwords anywhere. These passwords are not even stored on the device of the user, but are generated on-the-fly using the algorithm, by providing the master password.
