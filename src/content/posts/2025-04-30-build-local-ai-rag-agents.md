In this comprehensive tutorial, I walk through building your own local AI system using Qwen 3 and Ollama. Learn how to create powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and AI agents that run entirely on your machine - no API costs, complete privacy, and full control.

### What You'll Learn

- Setting up Qwen 3 with Ollama for local inference
- Building a RAG system for document question-answering
- Creating AI agents that can interact with local data
- Optimizing performance for consumer hardware
- Best practices for prompt engineering with local models
