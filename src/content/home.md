I'm a Software Security Engineer at Block Inc., specializing in cloud-native security pipelines and application security. 

Previously at Meta and Praetorian, I focused on building secure systems and contributing to the security community through research and open-source projects. I am also the CEO & Founder of OmniChat AI, where we developed a multimodal agentic AI platform that provides unified APIs for multimodal input processing, enabling developers to build complex applications with a single integration layer.
