I'm a Software Security Engineer at Block Inc. (formerly Square Inc.), where I focus on developing enterprise-scale cloud-native security pipelines and detection systems. With a Master's degree in Cybersecurity from Georgia Institute of Technology, I specialize in application security, cloud security, and security engineering.

My expertise spans across AWS cloud services, security tooling, and system administration. I have extensive experience in security auditing, vulnerability assessments, and developing security solutions. Previously, I've worked at Meta (Facebook) and Praetorian, where I contributed to various security initiatives including fuzzing infrastructure, security audits, and threat modeling.

I'm passionate about building secure systems and contributing to the security community. My research work spans across various domains including privacy-preserving techniques in cryptocurrencies, content moderation in encrypted systems, and secure system design.
