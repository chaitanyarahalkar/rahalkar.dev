      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/531.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Centralized or Decentralized? The Contact Tracing Dilemma&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; research paper having the following abstract - &amp;ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic created a noticeable challenge to the cryptographic community with the development of contact tracing applications. The media reported a dispute between designers proposing a centralized or a decentralized solution (namely, the PEPP-PT and the DP3T projects).
Perhaps, the time constraints to develop and deploy efficient solutions led to non-optimal (in terms
of privacy) solutions. Moreover, arguments have been severely biased and the scientific debate did
not really happen until recently. In this paper, we show the vulnerabilities and the advantages of
both solutions systematically. We believe that none offers any sufficient level of privacy protection
and the decision to use one or another is as hard as using automated contact tracing at the first
place. A third way could be explored. We list here a few possible directions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summarizing and Analyzing the Privacy-Preserving Techniques in Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://rahalkar.dev/talk/privacy-blockchain/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin and many other similar Cryptocurrencies have been in existence for over a decade, prominently focusing on decentralized, pseudo-anonymous ledger-based transactions. Many protocol improvements and changes have resulted in new variants of Cryptocurrencies that are known for their peculiar characteristics. For instance, Storjcoin is a Proof-of-Storage-based Cryptocurrency that incentivizes its peers based on the amount of storage owned by them. Cryptocurrencies like Monero strive for user privacy by using privacy-centric cryptographic algorithms.  While Cryptocurrencies strive to maintain peer transparency by making the transactions and the entire ledger public, user privacy is compromised at times. Monero and many other privacy-centric Cryptocurrencies have significantly improved from the original Bitcoin protocol after several problems were found in the protocol. Most of these deficiencies were related to the privacy of users. Even though Bitcoin claims to have pseudo-anonymous user identities, many attacks have managed to successfully de-anonymize users. In this paper, we present some well-known attacks and analysis techniques that have compromised the privacy of Bitcoin and many other similar Cryptocurrencies. We also analyze and study different privacy-preserving algorithms and the problems these algorithms manage to solve. Lastly, we touch upon the ethics, impact, legality, and acceptance of imposing these privacy algorithms.

      <title>Designing a Secure Device-to-Device File Transfer Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://rahalkar.dev/talk/container-best-practices/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Secure, reliable, and fast transfer of files across the Internet is a problem attempted to be solved through many application-layer protocols. In this paper, we aim to design a secure, reliable, open-design, and performant file transfer protocol that is inspired by the WebRTC protocol stack. Traditionally, transferring files involves a publicly exposed (available on the public network) third-party server that serves the uploaded files to the receiver. Here, the third-party server has to bear the storage and bandwidth cost to transfer the files between the two parties. We propose a protocol that uses a relay server to relay the files from the client to the server. A relay server has several advantages over a regular file-hosting server. Firstly, a relay server does not retain the uploaded files, it simply relays them. Secondly, a relay server has a full-duplex communication channel and therefore the receiver is not required to wait for the sender to upload the files completely. In this paper, we study available file transfer approaches and their known flaws. We propose our idea and compare our stack with WebRTC. Finally, we perform empirical analysis and, benchmark our device-to-device transfer approach along with other available options including WebRTC.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python has a large number of really cool modules that people don&amp;rsquo;t know about. These are quite helpful. People often tend to program the hard way since they don&amp;rsquo;t know about the existence of these modules. Such examples can be the itertools module, the secrets module to generate secure random numbers etc. Get a copy of the talk slides &lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/python-meetups-sept&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ethics for Platforms</title>
      <link>https://rahalkar.dev/talk/ethics-privacy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How much does the Internet know about you? It is a question that most of us will struggle to answer today. This illiteracy and nescience about the internal working of products and services that we use daily can prove to be exceedingly dangerous. The blind trust and complete faith of consumers in dot-com companies is being exploited at unprecedented levels, without the knowledge of the said beneficiaries. The lack of transparency in how our messages and other private data moves through the Internet, and how these tech giants make use of it has forced leaders like Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the WWW to radically overhaul his own creation! Migrating to a âDecentralized Internetâ may seem like a longshot at best, but it is a necessary transition that all of us will have to make when an eventual tipping point is reached and the people realize that the âData belongs to meâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask a 10-year-old Jack what Facebook is for, and heâll tell you it is âto help me make friendsâ
But, Facebookâs board is not working to help Jack make more friends. It is looking to make a hefty profit out of Jackâs social graph. The discernment that we are not the customers of Facebook, we are the product, Facebook is selling us to advertisers, is yet to kick-in.
Looking back at the last year, thereâs evidence that Internet has become more of a purveyor of lies than of truth because of the way the targeted advertising model encourages people to put things online which are likely to be clicked upon (Clickbait)
With the Indian SC declaring privacy as a âfundamentalâ right, it is clear that the companies who treat data ethics as a social responsibility as important as environmental awareness are tomorrowâs winners. Digital trust is paramount for digital growth and welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Content Addressed Peer-to-Peer File System for the Web with Blockchain-Based Metadata Integrity</title>
      <link>https://rahalkar.dev/talk/content-addressed-filesystem/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the exponentially scaled World Wide Web, the standard HTTP protocol has started showing its limitations. With an increased amount of data duplication &amp;amp; accidental deletion of files on the Internet, the P2P file system called IPFS completely changes the way files are stored. IPFS is a file storage protocol allowing files to be stored on decentralized systems. In the HTTP client-server protocol, files are downloaded  has from a single source. With files stored on a decentralized network, IPFS allows packet retrieval from multiple sources, simultaneously saving considerable bandwidth. IPFS uses a content-addressed block storage model with content-addressed hyperlinks. Large amounts of data can is addressable with IPFS with the immutable and permanent IPFS links with meta-data stored as Blockchain transactions. This timestamps and secures the data, instead of having to put it on the chain itself. Our paper proposes a model to use the decentralized file storage system of IPFS, and the integrity preservation properties of the Blockchain, to store and distribute data on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the ever-expanding World Wide Web, the data generated on the web has grown vastly. The amount of data generated daily is at a staggering 2.5 quintillion bytes. This pace is gaining constant momentum due to the inclusion of new IoT devices every day. Sensory data produced by IoT devices get bulkier as modern devices are added to the Internet. To counter the problem of data handling, many distributed file systems were introduced. The popular ones being Napster, BitTorrent, KaZaA, supporting millions of distributed users. Among all of them, HTTP - one of the oldest protocols on the Internet is the biggest distributed file system, when coupled with browsers allowing users to share files globally. With the increase in the scalability of the World Wide Web, the reliability of  HTTP began to degrade. Keeping track of terabytes of data and moving these files over the Web is a difficult task. Several other protocols were introduced to tackle the problem of scalability and decentralization with an intention of replacing the well-established reign of HTTP.
The other problem with HTTP is security and data integrity. As a countermeasure, the inclusion of Blockchain technology was introduced. Blockchain technology cannot be used to store the entire data due to its distributed ledger protocol. This protocol states that every node in the Blockchain must preserve a copy of the data, on the chain. Hence, storing petabytes of data on the Blockchain is infeasible. This model proposes to store only the file metadata, summarizing necessary information about data, on the Blockchain. This data, being in bytes for a single file, reduces the overall size of the ledger.&lt;/p&gt;
