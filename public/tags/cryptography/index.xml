      <title>Centralized or Decentralized? The Contact Tracing Dilemma</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/531.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Centralized or Decentralized? The Contact Tracing Dilemma&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; research paper having the following abstract - &amp;ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic created a noticeable challenge to the cryptographic community with the development of contact tracing applications. The media reported a dispute between designers proposing a centralized or a decentralized solution (namely, the PEPP-PT and the DP3T projects).
Perhaps, the time constraints to develop and deploy efficient solutions led to non-optimal (in terms
of privacy) solutions. Moreover, arguments have been severely biased and the scientific debate did
not really happen until recently. In this paper, we show the vulnerabilities and the advantages of
both solutions systematically. We believe that none offers any sufficient level of privacy protection
and the decision to use one or another is as hard as using automated contact tracing at the first
place. A third way could be explored. We list here a few possible directions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
